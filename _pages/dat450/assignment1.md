# DAT450/DIT247: Programming Assignment 1

Testing.

## Step 0: Preliminaries

Download the following texts.

## Step 1: Preprocessing the text

You will need a *tokenizer* that splits English text into separate words. In this assignment, you will just use an existing tokenizer. Popular NLP libraries such as SpaCy and NLTK come with built-in tokenizers. We recommend NLTK in this assignment since it is somewhat faster than SpaCy and somewhat easier to use.



## Step 2: Encoding the vocabulary

## Step 3: Developing a language model

## Step 4: Inspecting word embeddings
