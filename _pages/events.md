# Events

At the moment, we hold two regular events at NLP@DSAI: a weekly fika and a
tri-weekly reading group.

If you have a question about either, feel free to send an email to:
[nicolas.audinet@chalmers.se](mailto:nicolas.audinet@chalmers.se).

## Fika

We like to have a weekly fika together at **15:00 on Wednesday afternoons** in
the 8th floor lunchroom in the EDIT building. We sometimes have a particular
topic for these fikas, but mostly we tend to just catch up and talk about what
we have on our mind. Come join us if you'd like to get to know the group a bit
more!

## Reading Group

We hold a Natural Language Processing reading group about every 3 weeks.

For each meeting, a paper is selected that all members agree to read. A
designated member (the curator) prepares a concise summary of the paper and a
set of notes which they share with the group. Before the meeting, all members
are expected to read the paper and write their thoughts and concerns in the
shared notes. Then, during the meeting the curator guides the group through the
structured discussion based on the questions and themes emerging from the shared
notes. We are committed to maintaining a respectful and positive atmosphere,
where members are encouraged to critique ideas constructively and listen
actively to each other.

If you would like to join the reading group, please send an email to
[nicolas.audinet@chalmers.se](mailto:nicolas.audinet@chalmers.se).
