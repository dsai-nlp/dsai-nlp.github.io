I am interested in natural language processing: in our research group, we develop machine learning models and algorithms that analyse language written by humans. I have worked on variety of research problems within the field of NLP and my interests are quite wide. Most of the current research in our group involves questions around learned representations of words and text: how we can measure what information is expressed by language representations, and how we can control it.
